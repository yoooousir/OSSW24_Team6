# Graphic Summarization of Article

## Problem Identification and Analysis
After researching existing platforms like GitHub and FreshCode Club, we've identified a gap in the market for an intuitive, visually engaging tool that represents a keyword map of an article. While there are services that provide article summarization or keyword-based recommendations, tools that visually map the relationships between keywords within an article are lacking. This presents an opportunity to create a more user-friendly and visually appealing tool utilizing advanced AI models, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Project Name and Branding
**Project Name**: Graphic Summarization of Article

## Mission Statement
**Objective**: To provide a graphical summary of PDF-based articles in the form of a keyword network using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

**Target Audience**: Students and researchers who seek a quick and efficient understanding of academic articles.

### Key Features
1. **Automatic Keyword Extraction**: Utilizes state-of-the-art AI within the RAG framework to extract important keywords from uploaded articles.
2. **Visual Keyword Mapping**: Generates an interactive network map that displays relationships and hierarchy between keywords, providing an intuitive overview of the article's main concepts.
3. **Contextual Summaries**: Each keyword node presents contextual summaries from the article, aiding users in understanding each keyword’s significance within the overall document.
